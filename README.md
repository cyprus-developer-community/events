## Code of Conduct

Our goal is to have an awesome, inclusive and safe community meetup where people
meet, hang out together, chat, listen to talks, exchange ideas and make new
friends. Any harmful or discriminating behaviour will not be tolerated and
results in the offending person being expelled from the meetup.

For details on what kinds of behaviour are not tolerated and consequences for
violating these rules, we refer to the
[Berlin Code of Conduct](https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct).

_Note: BerlinJS has been a pioneer in the JavaScript User Group scene in Europe
and set a great example. We want to learn from and follow the best, hence we
allowed ourselves to copy a few things from them._
